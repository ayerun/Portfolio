								<h2>Overview</h2>
								<p>The goal of this project was to demonstrate understanding of Lagrangian dynamics. 
                                    Lagrangian dynamics is often overlooked in undergraduate dynamics courses, but it is the most fundamental way to model complex systems.
                                    In modern engineering, napkin dynamics calculations have been replaced by state-of-the-art simulations.
                                    Understanding how these simulations work enables an engineer to quantify the accuracy of a simulation.
                                </p>
                                
                                <h2>System Configuration</h2>
								<p>Lagrangian dynamics relies on configuration variables. 
                                    This jack in a box system has 6 degrees of freedom meaning there are 6 configuration variables, 3 for the box and 3 for the jack. 
                                    Each object can be fully defined with a x and y coordinate for position and an angle (&theta;) for orientation.
                                </p>

								<h2>Geometry</h2>
                                <p> It is important to stay organized when modeling a complex system.
                                    Using trigonometry for geometry calculations can be tedious and prone to error.
                                    I defined the system's geometry by placing reference frames at the ends of the jack and walls of the box. <br/>
                                    Using transformation matricies, I am able to track the position and orientation of all frames.
                                    This is critical for impact detection.

								<h2>Euler-Lagrange (EL) Equations</h2>
								<p> To calculate the EL equations, I started with potential and kinetic energy.
                                    For kinetic energy, I used the equation, 
                                    $$KE = \frac{1}{2}{V_b}^{T}IV_b.$$
                                    \(V_b\) is the body velocity<br/>
                                    I is the combined mass and inertia matrix<br/>
                                    I set to potential energy to 0 under the assumption that gravity is acting in the z direction (into the screen). 
                                    I calculated the Lagrangian by subtracting the potential energy from the kinetic energy, \(L=KE-PE\). 
                                    Finally, I formed the EL equations by differentiating the Lagrangian.
                                    $$\frac{d}{dt}(\frac{&delta;L}{&delta;\frac{dq}{dt}})-\frac{&delta;L}{&delta;q}=F$$
                                    q is a matrix of configuration variables<br/>
                                    F is a matrix of external forces on the system
                                </p>
                                
                                <h2>Constraints</h2>
                                <p>There are 16 constraints because each side of the jack can hit any of the four walls of the box. 
                                    I formed the constraint equations by calculating the position of tips of the jack in the frames of the box walls.
                                    Then, I set the x or y coordinate of the transformation matrix equal to 0 representing collision between the jack and the box.
                                    For the transformations between the jack and the left and right walls of the box, I set the x coordinate equal to zero. 
                                    For the transformations between the jack and the top and bottom walls of the box, I set the y coordinate equal to zero.
								</p>

								<h2>Impacts Update Laws</h2>
								<p>To calculate the impact update, I had to solve for the time derivative of the configuration variables after impact. 
                                    The configuration variables before and after impact are equivalent. 
                                    I made two substitutions dictionaries to do this (one with configuration variables before impact and one with configuration variables after impact). 
                                    I used the substitution dictionaries in the impact update equations.<br/></p>
                                <p>
                                    <b>Momentum Update:</b>
                                    $${\frac{&delta;L}{&delta;\frac{dq}{dt}}}^{+}-{\frac{&delta;L}{&delta;\frac{dq}{dt}}}^{-}=&lambda;\frac{&delta;&phi;}{&delta;q}$$
                                    &phi; is the impact constraint<br/>
                                    - represents configuration variables before impact<br/>
                                    + represents configuration variables after impact<br/></p>
                                <p>
                                    <b>Energy Update:</b>
                                    $$H^{+}-H^{-}=0$$
                                    $$H=(\frac{&delta;L}{&delta;\frac{dq}{dt}})(\frac{dq}{dt})-L$$
                                    H is the Hamiltonain<br/></p>
                                <p>
                                    Each constraint requires a different set of impact update equations.
                                    Because there are too many variables to solve these equations symbolically in python, I solved the equations when an impact is detected during simulation. 
                                    When an impact is detected, I substitute current values of the configuration variables and their time derivative into my impact update equations reducing the computational intensity of solving the equations. 
                                    During each step of the simulation, I check to see if any of the impact constraints have been met. 
                                    If the code detects impact, the impact equations are solved. 
                                    If the code detects no impact, the EL equations are solved.

								<h2>Testing</h2>
								<p>I heavily tested my code to ensure that it is functioning properly. 
                                    Since I modeled gravity in the z direction, it was easy to see how changing the initial condition affected my simulation. 
                                    I tested each initial condition individually by setting all other initial conditions and external forces to 0 and animating my solution to determine whether or not my simulation is realistic. 
                                    I then started to combine various initial conditions for testing. 
                                    After testing initial conditions, I tested external forces. 
                                    I used the same process to test external forces as I used to test initial conditions. 
                                    Once I was confident the external forces were accurate, I started to combine external forces and initial conditions. 
                                    I used the animation to check whether or not the simulation is realistic.
                                    The gif at the top of the page uses an initial box angular velocity of 1\(\frac{rad}{s}\), and applies external forces to the box. 
                                    The external forces are \(F_{x}=300sin(t)\) and \(F_{y}=300cos(t)\). 
                                    If you neglect  energy transfer between the jack and the box, these initial conditions and forces would cause the box to rotate about its center and follow a repeating semi-circle trajectory moving in the positive x direction. 
                                    My animation shows the box performing as predicted with slight variations due to energy transfer between the box and the jack. 
                                    The trajectory of the jack within the box looks realistic given the initial conditions and constants. 
                                    The mass of the jack is 4kg (a 1kg point mass at each end of the jack) and the mass of each wall of the box is 25kg.
                                </p>
