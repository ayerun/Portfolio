									<h1>Lunar Telerobotic Assembly Research</h1>
									<p>Led a team of engineers creating robotic hardware and software for<br />
										research in advancement of the NASA proposed FARSIDE mission</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Armstrong_Ames.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<h2>Overview</h2>
								<p>I began working at the Telerobotics Lab at University of Colorado Boulder as a systems engineer eventually becoming the lead engineer and project manager. Our research focuses on the robotic deployment of a low-frequency radio telescope on the lunar farside as part of the NASA proposed 
									<a href="https://science.nasa.gov/science-pink/s3fs-public/atoms/files/FARSIDE_FinalRpt-2019-Nov8.pdf" target="_blank">FARSIDE (Farside Array for Radio Science Investigations of the Dark Ages and Exoplanets)</a> 
									mission. Using a COTS rover and robotic arm, we developed a Telerobotic Simulation System (TSS) used in experiments to assess the risks and rewards of new technologies for low-latency telerobotic assembly tasks.
								</p>

								<h2>Human Factors Experiment</h2>
								<p>This experiment served to determine a methodology to accurately assess the situational awareness (SA) and cognitive load (CL) of an operator while performing telerobotic assembly tasks analogous to a robotic lunar mission. SA and CL along with task performance are critical metrics when assessing the effectiveness of a telerobotic system. The published work can be found 
									<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9172667" target="_blank">here</a>.<br />
								</p>

								<h2>Virtual Simulation Experiment</h2>
								<p>This work-in-progress serves to compare the effectiveness of virtual training to physical traning for telerobotic assembly failure recovery.</p>
								<p>
									<b>Motivation</b><br/>
									NASA is creating a sustainable human-lunar presence which requires large scale robotic surface operations. Direct teleoperation of all lunar robots will be inefficient. Collaborative control is a more semi-autonomous model that incorporates human ingenuity during failure response.<br/>

										<b>Figure 1.</b> Collaborative control flowchart. Robot is autonomous till it reaches a point of uncertainty. Human can provide robot with additional information or take direct control of robot.
									</div>
									In terms of the current failure response method for planetary rovers, the test rover for Curiosity is a prime example. 
									NASA created a hardware duplicate of Curiosity which they use on Earth in a simulated Martian environment. 
									This is a reasonable problem solving method for the martian rovers, however this method becomes very expensive and inefficient as the number of robots scales. 
									<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/gateway" target="_blank">The Gateway</a>
									could provide infrastructure for large data transfer with minimal latency allowing for new failure response methods.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>Research Objective 1: Analyze current technologies used in space to develop a new failure response method for robotic planetary assembly tasks</b><br/>
									When developing a new failure response strategy, we wanted to leverage existing technologies currently on board rovers or other space systems. 
									Curiosity and Perseverance have 3D mapping capabilities which could be used to virtually recreate the rovers' environment. 
									The <a href="https://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/iss/dextre/dextre-operated-camera.asp" target="_blank">Dextre-Operated Camera</a> 
									also leverages 3D mapping to inspect the ISS for damage. 
									Using these technologies, we can generate a virtual training environment in order to develop solutions to failures
									This idea is promising because 
									<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/001401300184378?needAccess=true" target="_blank">previous research</a> 
									has shown virtual training improves real world task performance.

									<b>Research Objective 2: Create a virtual recovery sandbox for problem solving assembly failures</b><br/>
