								<p>I've been an engineer since birth, but I was recently certified with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Colorado Boulder, and 
									I am currently working towards an M.S. in Robotics at Northwestern University (expected December 2021). 
									My passion for learning has led me down rabbit holes in many facets of engineering. 
									I am well versed in mechanical engineering, aerospace engineering, electrical engineering, mathematics, and computer science.
									Computer engineering is next on my list. 
									My goal as an engineer is to apply my talents to advance the human condition.
									I am currently looking for summer 2021 internships within the aerospace and robotics industries.
									Ideally, I would like to work as a cross-discipline engineer at a company with a mission similar to mine.
									Please do not hesitate to reach out.
